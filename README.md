# Kerala Covid Count

This is a React App that displays the daily count of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) numbers in Kerala.

### API
[COVID-19 India API](https://api.covid19india.org/)

### Link
[Link to the hosted website](https://kerala-covid-count.web.app/)

### Known issues
The API tends to reset the count to 0 after 12AM. I am currently working on an alternative to store the data on a server until 6pm next day, after which the new data can be fetched from the API.
